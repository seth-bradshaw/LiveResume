Welcome to my portfolio! This project was made with React, and Tailwind. The site is deployed [here](https://portfolio-r77du334c-seth-bradshaw.vercel.app/).

To run the project locally clone this repository, cd into LiveResume and run the following script:
`npm start`

The contact form will not work locally because my account information being stored in enviornment variables, and it is necessary for a successful request. Should you want to get this to work locally, please navigate to [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) to create an account. You will need to go through the process of creating an email template, once completed create enviornment variables to store your email template's ID along with your account ID. Be sure to name them the same as mine in ContactForm.js on lines 45-46. 

If you have any feedback please don't hesitate to share!
